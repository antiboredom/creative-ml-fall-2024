# Creative Applications of Machine Learning

**Instructor:** [Sam Lavigne](https://lav.io) | [splavigne@gmail.com](mailto:splavigne@gmail.com)  
**Time:** Thursdays 7pm to 8:40pm  
**Office Hours:** By appointment

## Description

In this class students will experiment with emerging techniques in machine learning, developing a series of creative works that address topics like classification, fakery, automating language, surveillance, and embodiment. The approach will be both practical and critical. How does machine learning produce and reproduce repressive status quo political, economic, ecological, and social conditions, and how might these technologies be used and mis-used to further more just political and social outcomes? How does the project of “AI” continue a long and bleak history of imperialist attempts to shape the world with data? How does creative experimentation reveal the qualities of machine learning as a medium and approach? Is it even possible to make an interesting project using stable diffusion? We will primarily use open source models and tools, but will also explore commercial products to probe their limitations, biases, politics, and business models.

## Readings

Readings are listed on the day they are assigned, not due. All readings that aren't already linked will be shared over Canvas. We'll devote a portion of each class to discussing the readings, with students taking turns leading the conversations.

## Schedule

### Week 1: Thursday, August 29, 2024

- Introductions
- Introduction to machine learning
- Review of p5js
- Introduction to ml5 (time permitting)

#### Readings

- Race After Technology (just the introduction), by Ruha Benjamin

#### Assignment: Embodiment (due Sepetember 19th)

- **Option 1:** Use a machine learning model that tracks the body to create a project that monitors, surveils, or enforces a behavior
